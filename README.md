## Division of customers for a subscription service
### Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the segments and trends of customers who subscribed for a service. By analyzing the various aspects of the available data, Iâ€™ll be identifying the different subscription types, and customer behavior. Key trends in subscription cancellations and renewals would also be analyzed; these would serve as the bedrock of recommendations to be made.
