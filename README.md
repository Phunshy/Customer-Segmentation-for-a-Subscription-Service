## Division of customers for a subscription service

### Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the segments and trends of customers who subscribed for a service. By analyzing the various aspects of the available data, I’ll be identifying the different subscription types, and customer behavior. Key trends in subscription cancellations and renewals would also be analyzed; these would serve as the bedrock of recommendations to be made.   

### Data Sources
Customer data, the primary dataset for this analysis was provided by LITA, and it contains detailed information about each subscription made by the customers.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1.	Data loading and inspection,
2.	Removing duplicates,
3.	Handling missing values,
4.	Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involved exploring the customer data to answer key questions such as:
1. Calculate the average subscription duration
2. Identify the most popular subscription types
Queries were also written and executed to extract key insights on the following:
-	retrieve the total number of customers from each region. 
-	find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
-	find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months. 
-	calculate the average subscription duration for all customers. 
-	find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months. 
-	calculate total revenue by subscription type. 
-	find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations. 
-	find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
